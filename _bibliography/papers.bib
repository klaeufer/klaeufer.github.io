 abstract = {In testing stateful abstractions, it is often necessary to record interactions, such as method invocations, and express assertions over these interactions. Following the Test Spy design pattern, we can reify such interactions programmatically through additional mutable state. Alternatively, a mocking framework, such as Mockito, can automatically generate test spies that allow us to record the interactions and express our expectations in a declarative domain-specific language. According to our study of the test code for Scala's Iterator trait, the latter approach can lead to a significant reduction of test code complexity in terms of metrics such as code size (in some cases over 70\% smaller), cyclomatic complexity, and amount of additional mutable state required. In this tools paper, we argue that the resulting test code is not only more maintainable, readable, and intentional, but also a better stylistic match for the Scala community than manually implemented, explicitly stateful test spies.},

@inproceedings{wl_honig_framework_2015,
 abbr = {IEEE},
 abstract = {Academic courses focused on individual microcomputers or client/server applications are no longer sufficient for students to develop knowledge in embedded systems. Current and near-term industrial systems employ multiple interacting components and new network and security approaches; hence, academic preparation requires teaching students to develop realistic projects comparable to these real-world products. However, the complexity, breadth, and technical variations of these real-world products are difficult to reproduce in the classroom. This paper outlines preliminary work on a framework architecture suitable for academic teaching of modern embedded systems including the Internet of Things. It defines four layers, two of which are at the edges of the network, and not adequately covered in academia. For each layer of the architecture, specific technology and suitable devices are identified. Desired academic outcomes for courses using projects based on the architecture are identified. Feedback and comparison is sought on how effective student course and research activities based on the framework will be to real-world embedded systems developers.},

While each layer of an OLFS volume constitutes a subvolume that can be mounted separately in a fan-in configuration, the entire hierarchy is always accessible (online) and fully navigable through any mounted layer. OLFS uses a relational database to store its layering metadata and either a relational database or any (virtual) host file system as its backing store, along with metadata and block caching for improved performance. Because OLFS runs as a virtual file system in user-space, its capabilities are available to all existing software without modification or special privileges. We have developed a reference implementation of OLFS for FUSE based on MySQL and XFS, and conducted performance benchmarking against XFS by itself. We explore several applications of OLFS, such as enhanced server synchronization, transactional file operations, and versioning.},

 abstract = {Processing markup in object-oriented languages often requires the programmer to focus on the objects generating the markup rather than the more pertinent domain objects. The BetterXML framework aims to improve this situation by allowing the programmer to develop a domain-specific object model as usual and later bind this model to preexisting or newly generated markup. To this end, the framework provides two types of object trees, XElement and NaturalXML, for representing XML documents. XElement goes beyond DOM-like automatic parsing of XML by supporting the custom mapping of elements to domain objects; NaturalXML allows the mapping of existing domain objects to XML elements using class metadata. Both types of object trees can be inflated and deflated by means of a common intermediate representation in the form of an event stream. Finally, the framework includes the XML Intermediate Representation (XIR), a lossless record-oriented representation of XML documents for efficient streaming and other types of data exchange.},

abstractNote = {Moore's law states that the number of transistors that can be placed on an integrated circuit doubles every two years (Moore, 1975). This has led to a steady increase in the processing power of computers over time, and technology is now enhancing and advancing software and scientific applications, which has enabled computationally intensive methods such as machine learning, data science, modeling, and simulation. The advancement of computers and data-driven algorithms is profoundly impacting people's lives. It is changing the way we work, the way we learn, and the way we interact with the world around us. Here, this editorial will discuss how scientists can benefit from the latest technology advancements and related tools by incorporating them into the ecological risk assessment (ERA) to study ecosystems as a way to create refined assessments and accelerate the turnaround times.},

abstract = {As sequencing technologies continue to drop in price and increase in throughput, new challenges emerge for the management and accessibility of genomic sequence data. We have developed a pipeline for facilitating the storage, retrieval, and subsequent analysis of molecular data, integrating both sequence and metadata. Taking a polyglot approach involving multiple languages, libraries, and persistence mechanisms, sequence data can be aggregated from publicly available and local repositories. Data are exposed in the form of a RESTful web service, formatted for easy querying, and retrieved for downstream analyses. As a proof of concept, we have developed a resource for annotated HIV-1 sequences. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted for >6,000 HIV-1 sequences revealing spatial and temporal factors influence the evolution of the individual genes uniquely. Nevertheless, signatures of origin can be extrapolated even despite increased globalization. The approach developed here can easily be customized for any species of interest.}

The initial version of the system is up and running as a public cloud service (SaaS) and supports project size (KLOC), defect density, defect spoilage, and productivity.

 abstract = {Trust in open-source software is a cornerstone of scientific progress and a foundation of high-quality public services. Just as standards are integral when judging the efficacy of a novel pharmaceutical compound or determining the spread of a new disease, the software used to make those determinations should be useful, error-free, reliable, performant, and secure. A small bug in an application, library, or framework can lead to economic loss and even loss of life. We rely on software developers to be dynamic and responsive to user review and bug-reporting. Our team developed an open-source modular pipeline to perform empirical investigations of software quality. A key innovation of our approach is to look at projects “from a distance” similar to methods used in climate, e.g. satellite images being used to observe environmental impacts in air quality/rain forests. Instead of looking at language-specific source code features, our pipeline uses a language-agnostic high-level approach to track software quality by focusing on the development process itself, which yields great insight into the processes programmers use to write and maintain their software. Our distributed modular approach to analytics allows the pipeline to be easily extended to support additional metrics in future work. We store extracted data in an embedded SQLite database, which means that analysis can proceed without complex server setup, let alone hosting the software on dedicated servers. Our analytical modules are designed for efficiency, and future runs of our software only collect missing data, supporting the incremental analysis of known, important open-source projects.},
